# tasparse

This Python script parses TAS recordings generated from https://jump.tf/forum/index.php/topic,1350.0.html into Recording, Frame, and Projectile classes with readable attributes for debugging.  Each class also has a function to output a string of its contents compatible for use with the original TAS plugin.

See the included IPython notebook `tasdebug.ipynb` for an example use case for overwriting recording bugs.
